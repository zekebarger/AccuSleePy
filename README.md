# AccuSleePy

## Description

AccuSleePy is a python implementation of AccuSleep--a set of graphical user interfaces for scoring rodent
sleep using EEG and EMG recordings. If you use AccuSleep in your research, please cite our

The data used for training and testing AccuSleep are available at https://osf.io/py5eb/

Please contact zekebarger (at) gmail (dot) com with any questions or comments about the software.

## Installation instructions

- (recommended) create a new virtual environment (using
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html),
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html),
etc.) using python >=3.10,<3.13
- (optional) if you have a CUDA device and want to speed up model training, [install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- `pip install accusleepy`

## Usage

`python -m accusleepy`
