# AccuSleePy

## Description

AccuSleePy is set of graphical user  interfaces for scoring rodent sleep
using EEG and EMG recordings.
It offers the following improvements over the MATLAB version (AccuSleep):

- Up to 10 brain states can be configured through the user interface
- Classification models can be trained through the user interface
    - Model files contain useful metadata (brain state configuration,
      epoch length, number of epochs)
    - Models optimized for real-time scoring can be trained
- Lists of recordings can be imported and exported for repeatable batch processing
- Undo/redo functionality in the manual scoring interface

If you use AccuSleep in your research, please cite our

## Installation

- (recommended) create a new virtual environment (using
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html),
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html),
etc.) with python >=3.11,<3.14
- (optional) if you have a CUDA device and want to speed up model training, [install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- `pip install accusleepy`
- (optional) download a classification model from https://osf.io/py5eb/ under /python_format/models/

Note that upgrading or reinstalling the package will overwrite any changes
to the [config file](accusleepy/config.json).

## Usage

`python -m accusleepy` will open the primary interface.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank [Franz Weber](https://www.med.upenn.edu/weberlab/) for creating an
early version of the manual labeling interface.
Jim Bohnslav's [deepethogram](https://github.com/jbohnslav/deepethogram) served as an
incredibly useful reference when reimplementing this project in python.
