The lower panel shows a zoomed-in subset of the epochs shown in the upper panel.
The red diamond in the upper panel and the red lines in the lower panel

The buttons next to the spectrogram control the zoom level and intensity.

If "auto-scroll" is enabled, modifying the brain state of the current epoch
will automatically select the next epoch.
