This is the current brain state configuration.

Each brain state has several attributes:

- Digit: this number is how the brain state is represented
    in label files. It's also the key on the keyboard that
    is used during manual scoring to set an epoch to this
    brain state.

- Enabled: whether a brain state for this digit exists.

- Name: the name of the brain state (e.g., REM). All names
    must be unique for the configuration to be valid.

- Scored: whether a classification model should try score
    this brain state. If you have a state that corresponds
    to missing or corrupted data, for example, you would
    probably want to uncheck this box.

- Frequency: the approximate relative frequency of this
    brain state in your data. This does not need to be
    very accurate, but it can influence classification
    accuracy a little bit. The frequency values for all
    scored brain states must add up to 1 for the
    configuration to be valid.
