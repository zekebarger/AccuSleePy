This is the current brain state configuration.
You can also choose the default epoch length.
If you make changes, click 'Save' to store them.

Each brain state has several attributes:

- Digit: how the brain state is represented in label files,
    and the key on the keyboard that, during manual scoring,
    sets an epoch to this brain state.

- Enabled: whether a brain state for this digit exists.

- Name: unique name of the brain state (e.g., REM).

- Scored: whether a classification model should output this
    brain state. If you have a state that corresponds to
    missing or corrupted data, for example, you would
    probably want to uncheck this box.

- Frequency: approximate relative frequency of this brain
    state. Does not need to be very accurate, but it can
    influence classification accuracy slightly. The values
    for all scored brain states must sum to 1.

Important notes:
- Changing these settings can invalidate existing label files,
    calibration files, and trained models!
- Reinstalling AccuSleePy will overwrite this configuration.
