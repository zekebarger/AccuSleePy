The lower panel shows a zoomed-in subset of the epochs shown in the upper panel.
The red diamond in the upper panel and the red lines in the lower panel
mark the currently selected epoch.
The red horizontal line in the upper panel indicates the epochs shown in the lower panel.
Click a location on the upper panel to jump to that epoch.
The buttons next to the spectrogram control the zoom level and intensity.
The buttons next to the EEG and EMG plots control the zoom level and y-axis offset.
If "auto-scroll" is enabled, modifying the brain state of the current epoch
will automatically select the next epoch.

Keyboard shortcuts:
Ctrl + S: save labels to file
Right arrow: move one epoch forward in time
Left arrow: move one epoch backward in time
Numbers 0-9: set current epoch to this brain state
Backspace: set current epoch to undefined
Ctrl + Z: undo last change to brain state labels
Ctrl + Y: redo last change to brain state labels
Shift + (number 0-9, or backspace):
    Click and drag on the upper plot of brain state labels to set the selected epochs
    to the desired brain state. Press Esc to cancel.
+: zoom in (upper panel x-axis)
-: zoom out (upper panel x-axis)
Shift + right arrow, or space: jump to the next epoch of a different state
    than the current epoch
Shift + left arrow: jump to the preceding epoch of a different state than the current epoch
Ctrl + right/left arrow: jump to the next/preceding undefined epoch
Ctrl + W: quit
