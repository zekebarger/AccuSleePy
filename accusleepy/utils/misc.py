# It's convenient to have the brain state labels start at 1 rather than 0.
# However, they need to be converted to the 0-n range for training and inference.
# So, we have to have a distinction between "brain states" (as represented in
# label files, keystrokes) and "classes" (AccuSleep's internal representation).
# This is confusing and I apologize.
